# Volcanoes
For a school project.
Ok ima be real w/ whoever got this, we both have no clue what we're doing. 
I missed like a whole week and my other partner missed the day we covered libararies. 
Enjoy!!
I also don't really know what to do w/ the read me.
var countryCounts prints a list of unique countries.
var mostErruptionsCountry Is useless. It doesn't do anything. Delete it.
var maxtErruptionsCountry Prints the country with the most erruptions.
var uniqueCE prints a list of unique years that occured in CE.
var latestErruptionVolcano Is also useless.
var newestErruption Prints the year the newest erruption occured.
If the notes loaded, there will be two notes about average elevation and all volcanoes that begin with a letter.
We never got arround to making those functions. Ignore the notes, they were just brainstorming ideas.
function findVolcano (area, maximumElevation, rockType) Generates volcanoe names based off the country they occured,
(cont.) what elevation they were at, and the rock type. I recommend checking the OG github page for rock types.

There should be some extra notes at the bottom. Ignore them.
